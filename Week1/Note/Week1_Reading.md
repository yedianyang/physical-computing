# A Brief Rant of the Future of Interaction Design

[A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/)

A video about vision of interaction, *is not visionary*. 

Timid increment from the status quo.

###### set off 动身

**Vision matter**, bisions give people a direction and inspire people to act.





### TOOLS

What is a tools?

​	A tool addresses **human needs** by amplifying **human capabilities**. a tool converts what we can do into what we want to do.

A great tools is designed to fit bothe sides.

#### Capabilities

**What people can do?**

Future people are all interactive with hand in the video

Hands do two things,



1. ##### Feel things

   People use hands to feel texture, pliability, tempearture; distribution of weight; their edges, curves, and ridges. how they respond in your hand as you use them.

   ###### use for granted 授之以康

   ###### tactile 触觉的

   

   ##### Pictures Under Glass, the thech that use screen. 

   Sacrifice all the tactile richness of working with hands.

   Pictures under glass is an interaction paradigm of permanent numbness. It's a Novocaine drip to the wrist. It denies ous hand what they do the best.

   Screen should not be the only path of the vision future.



2. ##### Manipulate

   **How hand manipulate things?**

   A it turn out, our fingers have rich and expressive repertoire(全部技能).

   “You've” made this switch with every jar you've opened. Not only without being taught, but probably without ever realizing you were doing it.

   **How's that for an intuitive interface?**

   3-D world. Hands are designed for moving and rotating objects in 3-D.

   

   ### HANDS are our future

    We should realize about the future is that it's a *choice*. 

   People choose which vision to pursue, people choose which research gets funded, people choose how they will spend their careers.

   

   Be inspired by the untapped potential of human capabilities.

   ### Invisible design

   “The best design is invisible” ?

   ​		" How design and technology will 'disappear', become 'invisible' or how the best interface is no interface'. "

   I agree with some of the reasons driving this movement; that design’s current infatuation with touchscreens is really problematic.

   Sensor:

   ​	GPS, NFC, Microphone, sixaxis, kinect

   

   ##### Ambient computing

   Focused on use more of our senses to get information.

   

   ### Invisible design propagates the myth of immateriality
